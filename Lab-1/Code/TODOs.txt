Refactor the code. 
Fix the memory leak.
Test deleting entire directory.
Test the testcases described in Mainv2.cpp.
Shift after every deletion so that we ensure valid entries are sorted, that way we dont need to loop over entire bucket when splitting. Only loop over the current entries.
Remove every pow and use bit manipulation instead eg pow(2, i) can be replaced by 1 << i.
Ask farah what hint 1 in deleteItem func means.
